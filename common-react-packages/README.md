1. reactstrap - Stateless React ComponentsStateless React Components, used for bootstrap and styling
2. classnames - Utility for conditionally combining CSS class names, Helps manage class names dynamically based on conditions.
3. font-awesome - Provides a library of icons and social logos.
4. react-datepicker - A date picker component for React, Itâ€™s customizable and supports features like date ranges, time selection, and localization.
5. react-dropzone - Simplifies the process of handling file uploads in a React application, including drag-and-drop functionality, file validation, and file previews.
6. rc-slider - Allows you to include sliders or range sliders in your application. Useful for selecting numerical values or ranges.
7. react-multi-carousel - Useful for displaying multiple items in a carousel format, with support for responsive designs, infinite looping, and custom controls.
8. react-select - Offers a rich set of features for dropdowns, including searchable options, multi-select, async options loading, and custom styling.
9. react-table - Allows you to create complex tables with features like sorting, filtering, pagination, and more. Highly customizable and efficient for handling large datasets.
10. react-toastify - Shows non-intrusive notifications to users in a React application. Customizable and supports different types of notifications like success, error, and info.

13. react-detect-click-outside - Useful for implementing behavior like closing dropdowns or modals when the user clicks outside of them. Provides a simple way to handle such interactions.
14. @zumper/react-ladda - (deprecated, use react-loader-spinner, react-spinners) Adds stylish loading buttons with animated spinners to your UI. Use for indicating that an action is in progress.
